### D. SHI

Dengliang Shi is my full name. If you are interested in artificial intelligence (AI), you might never heard about me. Beacuse I am still a rookie in this field, and I mainly focus on natural language processing (NLP). I started this blog to share what I have learned or found about NLP while help myself record some ideas. Discussion about anything about NLP is welcome, please do not hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:dengliang.shi@yahoo.com).
