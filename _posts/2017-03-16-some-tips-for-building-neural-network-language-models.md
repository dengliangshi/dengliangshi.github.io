### 1. Introduction
Numberous works about neural network language models (NNLMs) are arised, they the whole architecture of NNLMs or optimization techniques 

### 2. Initialization
The initialization of nerual network language models has a significant effect on the training, and the parameters of neural network language models needed to be initialized include feature vectors of words and weight matrixes of neural network. Each parameter is commonly initialized by a random number generated by a uniform distribution, and lower and upper  

### 3. Training Unit


### 4. Input Level


### 5. Unknown Words
In 

### 6. Other
using one dimension arrays for weight matrix will be much faster than using two dimension arrays.
