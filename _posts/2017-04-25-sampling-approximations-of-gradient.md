title: Sampling Approximation of Gradient.
abstract: Sampling approximation of gradient is a speed-up technique for trainging neural netowrk language models, and is proposaled by Bengio and Senecal. Three algorithms are represented by Bengio and Senecal, but only the importance sampling method worked finely for neural network language models. This post mainly focuses on improtance sampling, and converys it in a simpler and easier way.
